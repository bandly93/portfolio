		text: "I was given the name Band and was born in Oakland, CA on the year of 1993. I was raised with my two brothers, my mom, and my dad. Growing up many things weren't given to my family and we always had to work hard	for the things that we wanted. This includes a place to stay, food to eat, and the MacBook I used to code this website. After high school, I was fortunate enough to attend the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I earned a bachelor in Business Management Economics. From here you might be asking how I majored in Business but ended up making websites.",

		text:"A lot of it had to do with the lack of resources and proper education provided during my early years of schooling. Freshman year I was introduced to the term 'Computer Science or CS', I didn't pay too much mind to it because I thought it was just another way of saying you're studying engineering. Half way throughout my college education, I interned at a consulting firm in hopes of getting some hands on experience with the type of work I will be doing later in the future. The work I was responsible for was fun and exciting because I was putting together detailed reports that had a huge impact on fundings for future projects. As I got better at my job, I took on the primary role of the Junior Research Analyst who was responsible for writing and revising reports before sending it to my seniors for confirmation.",

		text:"Keep in mind that I was still in college and taking upper division courses for my major. At that point I learned how to balance a 20 hour per week office job with a full time university education. This lead to many all-nighters and coffee runs in the morning before work. It was very challenging but it was the best decision I’ve ever made and let me tell you why."

	{
		text:"As a business major at my university, you are required to take a few computer courses because that’s the university’s way of saying you should be more well-rounded. My senior year in college, I enrolled into a Java Programming and Database Management course that ignited my interest in computer science. One of my assignments in my Java course was to take in a txt file and output a new text file with certain letters removed. Being a natural problem solver, I quickly realized that the work I was doing at my job and my studies in school could go hand in hand. At the time I was doing a lot of manual data entry that included binary data sets (1 or 0 for true and false) from surveys we gathered for suicide prevention. I did a little research and learned that SQL would make things more efficient and mitigate the chance of entry error passing data validation. Therefore, I simply wrote a query to retrieve all survey ID’s that responses weren’t binary. This made my task much more efficient because I didn't have to manually look for those entry errors anymore. Shortly after I graduated from college and worked in my respective field for a year, but ultimately decided to switch careers and move into software engineering. My full-time studying began April 2016 and two plus years later here I am creating my personal porfolio from scratch."
